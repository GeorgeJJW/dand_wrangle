    "Twitter account WeRateDogs ([@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates)) has been claiming that they know a lot about dogs. They are claiming that they are professional dog raters, and that most of the dogs they rated were indeed very good. Being a cat person and all, I was not quite convinced, so I grabbed every original tweet that they posted about dogs up to August 2017. I wanted to see for myself just how good these dogs were."

Most dogs received a rating ratio of 1.0 to 1.2, with relatively few dogs received a rating ratio below 1.0. In other words, most dogs received a rating of more than 10/10. These must have been some really good dogs, or so they said."
